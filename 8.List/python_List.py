# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List[]                 :- is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple()                :- is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set {}                 :- is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary{Key: value} :- is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
